Comment: Removing files for the following reasons:
 3rd-party -  we use existing Debian packages where needed
 benchmarks - the source of the code/data is unclear, and we have no
              need for it
 sandbox -    ditto
 docs -       we rebuild from source
 tfprof -     the excluded JavaScript/ES6 libraries are in other existing
              Debian packages or are unused

 PREAMBLE
 The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
 development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
 efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
 open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
 with others.
 .
 The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
 to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
 .
