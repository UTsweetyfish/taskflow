Description: Parallel and Heterogeneous Task Programming System for C++
 Taskflow helps you quickly write parallel and heterogeneous task
 programs with high performance and simultaneous high productivity. It
 is faster, more expressive, with fewer lines of code, and easier for
 drop-in integration than many of existing task programming libraries.
 It is provided as a collection of C++ header files, using C++17.
